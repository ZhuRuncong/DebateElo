The Reality Splitter is a technology which, when utilised, can “split” geographic areas into two localised parallel dimensions occupying the same geographic space. Once “split,” changes in one localised parallel dimension do not affect events that go on in the other.* However, space outside the area in which the Reality Splitter is used is entirely unaffected. When people enter a physical area in which the Reality Splitter was used for the first time, they must choose up to one of the parallel dimensions to enter. Once that person chooses which dimension to enter, they will only ever “see” that dimension when they occupy that physical area for the rest of their lives. *For example, if someone were to use the Reality Splitter in a forest, two forests occupying the same overlapping space would now exist. In one dimension, people could remove trees from the forest, while in the other dimension the forest would be entirely unaffected.",3

Love has three phases: lust, attraction, and attachment.In phase one (lust), the brain produces testosterone and estrogen, driving individuals to seek sexual gratification with a given person.In phase two (attraction), the brain produces more dopamine and norepinephrine, but less serotonin, than usual. This causes individuals to feel euphoric around their loved one, but also leads to intense infatuation with them. Phase two usually lasts between six months and three years.In phase three (attachment), individuals’ attraction goes down. The brain instead produces more oxytocin and vasopressin, prompting individuals to bond with and nurture their partner. While lust and attraction are exclusive to sexual and romantic interests, attachment happens just as it does for others in one’s life, such as close friends and family members.",8

In 2018, He Jiankui used then-novel CRISPR/Cas9 technology to genetically engineer a fetus for implantation into a donor mother. The aim of the genetic edit was to produce a mutation of the CCR5 gene allegedly conferring resistance against HIV-AIDS. The pregnancy led to the birth of two twin girls, known by the pseudonyms Lulu and Nana. He and the experiment were the subject of near universal condemnation.

Black theology has historically animated various movements, including (most famously) the Abolitionist Movement and the Civil Rights Movement led by stalwarts like Pauli Murray, Maria Stewart, Martin Luther King, and Malcolm X.

In the micro-level, doctors search through published literature on the best approach to diseases, and develop their own medical repertoire. For example, searching for the best dosage for anti-high blood drugs, and looking for journal articles on the topic. In the macro-level, medical societies designate committees for diseases that formulate consensus clinical practice guidelines, which are based on multiple clinical studies, randomized trials, and meta-analyses globally, all aiming to consolidate data and evidence around specific recommendations. For example, the criteria for diagnosing lupus was first created in 1997, then refined in 2012, then again in 2019, and now the Asia-Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology (APLAR), has released guidelines for lupus tailored for Asia-Pacific only last 2021.",3

You have won several championships and currently employ the reigning multi-world champion, Max Verstappen. The second driver that you employ, Sergio """"Checo"""" Perez, is sponsored by big name corporations, such as: Disney, Telcel, Mobil, Claro, Nescafe, and Kitkat. The money that Checo's sponsors bring to the team allow you to afford employing Max. However, in the current 2024 F1 Season, Checo has been underperforming and has costed millions of money for car repairs. This has led to Red Bull getting closer to F1's cost cap. As a consequence, Red Bull is limited in implementing upgrades on the car and is vulnerable to falling behind other competitors who can afford to spend on upgrades throughout the remainder of the season. In response, different managerial and rank-and-file employees in the team have tried to push you to fire Checo, and replace him with a more promising younger driver. However, the sponsors who have backed Checo, have threatened to pull out their funding for Red Bull if Checo was fired. Despite the rest of the team’s frustration, Max has worked well with Checo for the past 3 seasons together.",1
